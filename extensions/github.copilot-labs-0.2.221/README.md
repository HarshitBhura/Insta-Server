# GitHub Copilot Labs

GitHub Copilot Labs is a companion extension to [GitHub Copilot](https://copilot.github.com) that houses experimental and up-and-coming features in a sidebar.

To learn more about GitHub Copilot Labs, [read our post](https://next.github.com/projects/copilot-labs/).

## Requirements

1. Access to Labs is limited to the same group of testers that have access to the technical preview of GitHub Copilot. If you don’t have access to the technical preview, you will
   see an error when you try to use this extension. Don’t have access yet? [Sign up for the waitlist](https://github.com/features/copilot/signup)
   for your chance to try it out. GitHub will notify you once you have access.
2. You must have the main extension of [GitHub Copilot](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot) installed alongside Labs.

## Technical Preview

This technical preview is a Beta Preview under the
[GitHub Terms of Service](https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-terms-of-service#j-beta-previews).

## Usage

For now Copilot Labs consists of a VS Code sidebar that houses distinct features. Once the Copilot Labs extension is installed, you'll see a Copilot icon in the sidebar. Clicking on that will bring up all of the experiments in separate panels.
